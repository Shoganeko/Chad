# jho bot's permission system

### Summary
Jho's permission system works with roles. You can assign a role specific commands, and whoever is 
assigned with that role gets those permissions.

### How To
Replace j! with your guild's prefix.

Things within <> are required, things within [] are not.
#### Commands
catfact, catgallery, eightball, photoeditor, random, russianroulette, logging, im, prefix, purge, guildinfo, help, redditnew, reddittop, steam, updatelog, userinfo, kick, ban
###### _Add Permissions to Role_
`j!perm role <role's name> add <command(s)>`
###### _Remove Permissions to Role_
`j!perm role <role's name> remove <command(s)>`
###### _View Permissions on a Role_
