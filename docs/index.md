## Want the bot in your own discord server?
[Click Here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=490728748501434369&permissions=2146958839&scope=bot)<br />
If you don't like the bot having some of the permissions, feel free to remove them. The bot will automatically check for them,
and if it doesn't have it it will notify.

I don't know what you'd intend to use it for, due to the watermarks etc. If you want to take a piece of the code, go ahead. If you could give credit, that'd be better. Thanks!
