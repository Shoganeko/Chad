##### Personal Use
We do not provide any support for personal usage of the bot. There's no point of using the bot for personal usage, or at least the provided jar(s) due to watermarks. If you plan to use part of the bot, credit would be greatly appreciated. 

##### Contribute
We urge you not to run your own modified version of Chad. If you have ideas on how to improve Chad, please consider contributing.
